This is a compilation of all of LeoV's Flash tools that were posted on his old Tumblr account.

He'd said originally that he was working on migrating all of these to a respository here on GitHub, but the link provided to that repository is not valid — the repository doesn't exist.


I don't know what happened and I personally haven't been in-contact with LeoV.
I am NOT claiming ownership of anything in here.
I'm simply re-uploading these here for easy-access.

------------------------------------

A couple things to note:


The `LeoV_Flash_Tools.zip` archive contains the `tools` folder and all of its contents.
The `LeoV_tumblr.zip` archive contains the `saved_tumblr_webpages` folder and all of its contents.
If you wish to view the webpages in the `saved_tumblr_webpages` directory, simply open one of the `HTML` files in your browser.
Take care not to alter the placements of any files and/or folders, unless you change the file-paths to match.
NOTE THAT the hyperlinks on those webpages will not redirect you to their target-pages correctly.


MISC FILES

Please note that the files within the `Misc Files` folder are a compilation of miscellaneous tools/scripts LeoV uploaded to his Tumblr on Jan 9th 2015 named `some-files.rar`.
They have not yet been organised.
Also, some of those files might be duplicates of Tools which have their own folders.


MESH TRANSFORMATION

Currently, I do not (to my knowledge) have a fully functional version of his 'mesh transformation' tool. The `FLA` and `s` files were acquired through decompilation.
I am not familiar with his mesh tool(s), and as such I cannot guide anyone through using them/their ActionScript. (If the scripts are complete and functional, anyone who knows how to use them - I would greatly appreciate you contacting me. See my profile for my info.)

-------------------------------------

His Tumblr account is now only accessible via the WaybackMachine (or other similar websites), and the hyperlinks don't redirect properly, although you can still derive the URLs from the hyperlinks - which is what I did so I could download the files I didn't already have.
(Those URLs are all listed in the `URLs_to_files.txt` file, which is in the same folder as this READ_ME.)



I would like to update this repository, in time, to make it more intuitive, perhaps revise his tutorials/explanations and altogether just organise the everything better


For now, this repos will act as a simple back-up of all the tools posted on his Tumblr account.


Have fun peeps
Peace 'n' hairgrease
